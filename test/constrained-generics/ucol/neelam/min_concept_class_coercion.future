unimplemented feature: allow implicit conversions for implementations

This test wants to implement 'proc LT(x:T, y:T):bool' for T=D
using a proc on D's superclass: 'proc LT(x:C, y:C) : bool'.
Currently this is not implemented.

See also #16412 for the design question: should this be allowed at all?
