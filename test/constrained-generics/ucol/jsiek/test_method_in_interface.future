unimplemented feature: 'implements' on class types
#17262

Technically speaking, the code as written is incorrect:
'LessThan' is implemented only for 'borrowed C'
while minFn() is being invoked on 'owned C'.

However, this future asks the question: what should this code look like?

Somewhat related: it is unreasonable to pass 'owned' things directly into
minFn(), as one of the two arguments will inevitably get destroyed.
