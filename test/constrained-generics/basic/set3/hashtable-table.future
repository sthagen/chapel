bug: compiler crashes when compiling this test with --no-local

This is a small reproducer of a problem with --no-local compilations
of rev. fe4b408912 of these two files when compiled together:
  test/constrained-generics/hashtable/MyHashtable.chpl
  test/constrained-generics/hashtable/test-chpl-hashtable.chpl

where testConcrete() compiles fine while testIC() causes an assertion
failure in the codegen pass.

The PR that adds this test also adds a workaround in MyHashtable.chpl
by adding an implicit ref-intent for the receiver argument or
the method 'proc tableType.this(idx: int)'.

Here is a possible set of steps taht cause the assertion failure:
* the method 'HT.table' returns a ref to 'tableType'
* it is passed to the method 'tableType.this()' by default intent
* when early-resolving testIC(), which contains the above two,
  the compiler treats 'tableType' as a record, so the default intent
  is a [const] ref
* when instantiating testIC() for my__hashtable, 'tableType' is _ddata,
  for which is the default intent is by value
* no further resolution happens upon this instantiation,
  so the AST is likely left in an inconsistent state w.r.t.
  by-ref vs. by-value argument passing

This future poses the question of whether the compiler should be
adjusted to compile this code properly or report an error like
"cannot use the default intent on arguments of interface types".
