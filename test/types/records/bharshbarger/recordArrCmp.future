bug: confusing compiler error when comparing records with array fields

After changing the logic default record comparisons via #14752, compiler creates
something that is probably closer to what we want for this to work. However, as
array comparisons are promoted, in the end it generates a promoted expression
that throws off the compilation.

                                                   future in)

Previous future report:
-----------------------
bug: Generated C code fails to compile when the != or == operators are used between records containing an array.
